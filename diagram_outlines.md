## Outline Diagrams

This section outlines various diagrams that would be beneficial for visually representing the system's actors, interactions, processes, and architecture. It does not provide the diagrams themselves but describes their scope and purpose.

### 2. Sequence Diagrams (Examples)

Sequence diagrams will detail specific user interactions or system processes, showing the messages exchanged between different components or objects over time.

*   **Student Submits Assignment:**
    *   **Actors/Components:** Student (Browser), Web Server (Laravel), `AssignmentController`, `SubmissionController`, `Submission` Model, `Attachment` Model, File Storage Service, Database.
    *   **Flow:** Student views assignment -> Uploads file (if any) -> Enters text (if any) -> Clicks "Submit" -> HTTP Request to `SubmissionController@store` -> Request validation -> File processing & storage (via `Attachment` model & File Storage Service) -> `Submission` record creation in DB -> HTTP Response (success/failure) -> Student sees confirmation.

*   **Instructor Grades Submission:**
    *   **Actors/Components:** Instructor (Browser), Web Server (Laravel), `AssignmentController` (or a dedicated `GradingController`), `Submission` Model, Database, (potentially Notification Service).
    *   **Flow:** Instructor views submission list -> Selects a specific submission -> Enters grade and feedback -> Clicks "Save Grade" -> HTTP Request to controller action -> Request validation -> `Submission` record updated in DB with grade/feedback -> (Optional: Notification sent to student) -> HTTP Response -> Instructor sees confirmation.

*   **User (Student/Instructor) Authenticates (Login):**
    *   **Actors/Components:** User (Browser), Web Server (Laravel), `LoginController` (or similar Auth controller), `User` Model, Session Service, Database.
    *   **Flow:** User enters credentials -> Clicks "Login" -> HTTP Request to login route -> Credentials validated against `User` records in DB -> Session started/updated -> Cookie set in browser -> HTTP Redirect to dashboard -> User views dashboard.

*   **Admin Updates Homepage Content:**
    *   **Actors/Components:** Admin (Browser), Web Server (Laravel), `DashboardController`, `HomeContent` Model, Database.
    *   **Flow:** Admin navigates to "Edit Home Content" page -> Modifies form fields (text, uploads new image) -> Clicks "Save" -> HTTP Request to `DashboardController@updateHomeContent` -> Request validation -> Image file stored (if changed) -> `HomeContent` record updated in DB -> HTTP Response -> Admin sees confirmation and updated content preview.

### 3. Activity Diagrams (Examples)

Activity diagrams can illustrate workflows with a focus on the flow of control and activities.

*   **Course Creation and Initial Setup by Instructor:**
    *   Activities: Log in -> Navigate to "Create Course" -> Fill course details form -> Submit form -> System creates course (draft status) -> Add chapters -> Add resources to chapters (rich text, files, links) -> Publish course.
    *   Decision points: Add another chapter? Add another resource? Ready to publish?

*   **User Registration, Profile Completion, and Email Verification:**
    *   Activities: User navigates to registration -> Fills registration form -> System creates user account (inactive/pending verification) -> System sends verification email -> User clicks verification link in email -> System verifies email, activates account -> User logs in -> System prompts for profile completion -> User fills profile details -> Profile marked as complete.

### 4. Component Diagram (High-Level)

A component diagram will show the overall architecture of the system, highlighting the main software components and their relationships.

*   **Components:**
    *   **Client Tier:**
        *   **Web Browser:** Renders the UI (React components via Inertia.js), handles user input, executes client-side JavaScript.
    *   **Application Tier:**
        *   **Web Server (e.g., Nginx, Apache):** Receives HTTP requests, serves static assets, acts as a reverse proxy for the application.
        *   **Laravel Application (PHP-FPM):**
            *   **Routing Engine:** Maps URLs to controller actions.
            *   **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests, interact with models and services, prepare data for views/Inertia responses.
            *   **Models (Eloquent ORM):** Represent database tables, manage data persistence and relationships.
            *   **Middleware:** Handles cross-cutting concerns (authentication, CSRF, Inertia requests).
            *   **Inertia.js Adapter:** Bridges Laravel backend with React frontend.
            *   **Services:** Encapsulate specific business logic (e.g., QuizService, NotificationService - if explicitly created).
        *   **Vite Server (Development):** Handles Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and serves assets during development.
    *   **Data Tier:**
        *   **Database Server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite):** Stores all persistent application data (users, courses, submissions, etc.).
        *   **Cache Server (e.g., Redis):** Stores session data, cached queries, etc.
    *   **External Services / Storage:**
        *   **File Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Local Storage):** Stores user-uploaded files (avatars, course materials, assignment attachments).
        *   **(Potentially) Email Service:** For sending transactional emails (verification, notifications).

*   **Key Interactions:**
    *   Browser <-> Web Server (HTTP/HTTPS)
    *   Web Server <-> Laravel Application (FastCGI/PHP-FPM)
    *   Laravel Application <-> Database Server (SQL)
    *   Laravel Application <-> Cache Server
    *   Laravel Application <-> File Storage
    *   Laravel Application <-> Email Service (SMTP/API)
    *   Browser <-> Vite Server (WebSocket for HMR during development)## Outline Diagrams
