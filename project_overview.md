## Project Overview

The project is an E-Learning Platform developed for ENSIASD Taroudant, a higher education institution. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive and interactive online learning environment for both instructors and students. The platform aims to streamline the educational process by enabling instructors to easily create, manage, and deliver diverse educational content, including course materials, assignments, and quizzes. For students, it offers a centralized hub to access courses, track their academic progress, submit assignments, and actively participate in course-related discussions and announcements.

The target audience for this platform comprises the instructors and students of ENSIASD Taroudant. The system is designed to cater to their distinct needs within the educational ecosystem.

Key functionalities of the E-Learning Platform include:

*   **Course Creation and Management:** Instructors can design courses, organize them into chapters, and upload various types of resources (files, rich text, external links).
*   **Assignment Handling:** Creation of assignments by instructors, submission by students, and subsequent grading capabilities.
*   **Quiz Administration:** Tools for creating and managing quizzes within courses to assess student understanding.
